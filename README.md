# Raycasting-Demo
Demo of raycasting done in JavaScript

This uses an old, messy framework that I created in order to follow along to youtube tutorials by 'The Coding Train' (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw), since he does all of his tutorials using a JavaScript framework called 'P5.js', and I wanted to attempt to recreate his projects from scratch without the use of frameworks.

I have since created better, more clean / efficient ways of doing this, but uploading this old project anyway as a demonstration.
